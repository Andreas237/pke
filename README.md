# Passive Keyless Entry Exploits

This repo contains gnuradio blocks and python scripts for emulating and spoofing the RF messages sent by the PKE system in a car to the key fob.  These messages can be used to force the fob to transmit, without requiring interacting with the physical fob.  

All attacks in the repo are based on a 2014 Toyota Yaris, however the attack is easily customizable to other manufacturers.
